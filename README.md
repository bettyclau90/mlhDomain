# mlhDomain

Hi guys,

This repo is for MLH challenge @ ShellHacks 2020.
Trhough domain.com we registered the domain name flyingup.space 

We designed a basic layout using the website builder from domain.com itself.
There is a lot work to do on it, including secure it with an SSL certificate and decide its final use. But the domain has the potential for us to build something great on it.
